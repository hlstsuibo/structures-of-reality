# Structures of Reality

Making visible the structural conditions under which decentralized life remains possible in reality—not merely in networks.

I am not here to persuade.  
I am only making the structures of reality visible.

Decentralized existence is a condition of being, not a protocol.

## First Nature: Learning

A unified whole of capacity, will, and action,
initially structured by genetics,
and taking the active absorption of differences
and the continuous adjustment of behavior
as its mode of existence.

Humans are beings whose way of being is learning.

第一自然性：學

一種由基因提供初始結構、
以主動吸收差異並調整自身行為
作為存在方式的能力、意志與行為的統一體。

人是以「學」為存在方式的存在。

## Second Nature: Self

A structure generated in the continuous process of learning,
serving to delineate the boundary between self and world,
with the maintenance of its own continuity of existence as its core orientation. 
It integrates
the demands of survival,
the will to choose,
and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, thereby enabling the individual to establish its “being-there”
and to endure as an acting subject. 

Humans are beings whose existence is bounded by the self.

第二自然性：自我

一種在持續「學」的過程中生成的結構，
用以界定自身與外界的邊界，
並以維持自身連續存在為核心取向。
它統合了生存的需求、選擇的意志
與對行為後果的承擔，
使個體得以確認「此在」，
並持續作為一個行動主體存在。

人是以自我為存在邊界的存在。

## Third Nature: Aspiration

A directional structure generated upon
the information absorbed through learning
and the existence-boundary formed by the self. 
It transforms acquired differences
into value weightings and orientations toward the future,
driving the individual to make choices and take action
amid multiple possibilities,
thereby enabling existence not merely to continue,
but to acquire directional meaning.  

Humans are beings whose existence takes direction through aspiration.

第三自然性：向往

一種在「學」所吸收的信息
與「自我」所形成的存在邊界之上
生成的方向性結構。
它將已獲得的差異信息
轉化為價值權重與未來指向，
驅動個體在多種可能性中作出取捨與行動，
使存在不僅得以延續，
更獲得趨向性的意義。

人是以向往為存在方向的存在。
