# Structures of Reality

Making visible the structural conditions under which decentralized life remains possible in reality—not merely in networks.

I am not here to persuade.  
I am only making the structures of reality visible.

Decentralized existence is a condition of being, not a protocol.

## First Nature: Learning

A unified whole of capacity, will, and action,
initially structured by genetics,
and taking the active absorption of differences
and the continuous adjustment of behavior
as its mode of existence.

Humans are beings whose way of being is learning.

## Second Nature: Self

A structure generated in the continuous process of learning,
serving to delineate the boundary between self and world,
with the maintenance of its own continuity of existence as its core orientation. 
It integrates
the demands of survival,
the will to choose,
and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, thereby enabling the individual to establish its “being-there”
and to endure as an acting subject. 

Humans are beings whose existence is bounded by the self.

## Third Nature: Aspiration

A directional structure generated upon
the information absorbed through learning
and the existence-boundary formed by the self. 
It transforms acquired differences
into value weightings and orientations toward the future,
driving the individual to make choices and take action
amid multiple possibilities,
thereby enabling existence not merely to continue,
but to acquire directional meaning.  

Humans are beings whose existence takes direction through aspiration.
