Structures of Reality

Making visible the structural conditions under which decentralized life remains possible in reality—not merely in networks.

I am not here to persuade.  
I am only making the structures of reality visible.

Decentralized existence is a condition of being, not a protocol.

注：「是其所是」是如此存在、如此運作、如此顯化。
「是其所是」並非描述性語句，而是一種邊界語句，用以阻止指向的對象化、功能化與價值化。

Note:
“Being such as it is” means existing in this way, operating in this way, and manifesting in this way.
“Being such as it is” is not descriptive but delimiting, functioning as a boundary statement that blocks the objectification, functionalization, and valorization of reference.

## 🌱 Root 

## First Nature: Learning

A unified whole of capacity, will, and action,
initially structured by genetics,
and taking the active absorption of differences
and the continuous adjustment of behavior
as its mode of existence.

Humans are beings whose way of being is learning.

第一自然性：學

一種由基因提供初始結構、
以主動吸收差異並調整自身行為
作為存在方式的能力、意志與行為的統一體。

人是以「學」為存在方式的存在。

## Second Nature: Self

A structure generated in the continuous process of learning,
serving to delineate the boundary between self and world,
with the maintenance of its own continuity of existence as its core orientation. 
It integrates
the demands of survival,
the will to choose,
and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, thereby enabling the individual to establish its “being-there”
and to endure as an acting subject. 

Humans are beings whose existence is bounded by the self.

第二自然性：自我

一種在持續「學」的過程中生成的結構，
用以界定自身與外界的邊界，
並以維持自身連續存在為核心取向。
它統合了生存的需求、選擇的意志
與對行為後果的承擔，
使個體得以確認「此在」，
並持續作為一個行動主體存在。

人是以自我為存在邊界的存在。

## Third Nature: Aspiration

A directional structure generated upon
the information absorbed through learning
and the existence-boundary formed by the self. 
It transforms acquired differences
into value weightings and orientations toward the future,
driving the individual to make choices and take action
amid multiple possibilities,
thereby enabling existence not merely to continue,
but to acquire directional meaning.  

Humans are beings whose existence takes direction through aspiration.

第三自然性：向往

一種在「學」所吸收的信息
與「自我」所形成的存在邊界之上
生成的方向性結構。
它將已獲得的差異信息
轉化為價值權重與未來指向，
驅動個體在多種可能性中作出取捨與行動，
使存在不僅得以延續，
更獲得趨向性的意義。

人是以向往為存在方向的存在。


## 🌱The Structure of Reality: Quanli—Information(現實的結構：權力—信息)

## 🌱Quanli—Information

🌱Quanli

Quanli is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is Quanli.
Quanli itself is all structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, requiring no designation.
Quanli encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through Quanli; destruction itself is also Quanli.
Quanli, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱Information

Information is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is information.
Information itself is all processes, results, events, and facts, requiring no designation.
Information encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through information; destruction itself is also information.
Information, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱權力（Quanli）

權力即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即權力。 
權力本身就是一切結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，無需指稱。 
權力含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。 
存在，以權力方式解構，依權力顯化，毀滅本身，亦是權力。
權力，除非毀滅，不可消除。

🌱信息（information）

信息即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即信息。
信息，本身就是一切過程、結果、事件、事實，無需指稱。
信息含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。
存在，以權力方式解構，以信息顯化，毀滅本身，亦是信息。
信息，除非毀滅，不可消除。


## 🌱One Body, Two Faces:

In ordinary perception
The universe seems like an automatically operating “Quanli encoder”, seemingly continuously pumping out Quanli understood as “laws” into “phenomenal flow” as information.
In this feeling, information seems to depend on Quanli for its manifestation, while Quanli is expressed in some form.
At the ontological level
Without Quanli, there is no information; without information, there is no Quanli.
Not juxtaposed, no separation, no dependence, no sequence.
Gazing at its structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, it is Quanli;
Gazing at its processes, unfoldings, results, and events, it is information.

🌱一體兩面：

通常感觀上：
宇宙彷彿一部自動運行的「權力編碼器」，似乎不斷將被理解為「法則」的權力泵出為「現象流動」的信息。
在這種感受中，信息似乎依賴權力而顯現，權力以某種形式被表達。
本體上：
離開權力，無信息；離開信息，無權力，不並列無拆分，不依賴無先後。
凝視其結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，是權力；  
凝視其過程、展開、結果、事件，是信息。

🌱Quanli—Information

Quanli is the structure, law, manifestation, and process of "being such as it is":
Structure is Quanli:
Cosmic structures, social structures, chemical structures, physiological structures are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;
Law is Quanli:
Cosmic laws, social laws, chemical laws, physiological laws are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;
Manifestation is Quanli:

Process is Quanli:
Cosmic processes, social processes, chemical processes, physiological processes are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;

Unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

Information is the state, fact, event, and process of "being such as it is":

🌱權力-信息（Quanli—Information）

權力即「是其所是」的結構、法則、顯化、過程：
結構是權力：
宇宙結構、社會結構、化學結構、生理結構都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；
法則是權力：
宇宙法則、社會法則、化學法則、生理法則都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；
顯化是權力：

過程是權力：
宇宙過程、社會過程、化學過程、生理過程都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；

除非毀滅，不可消除。

宇宙狀態、社會狀態、化學狀態、生理狀態都是信息，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的信息；
事實是信息：

除非毀滅，不可消除。


🌱Quanli—Information Is Not Two Juxtaposed Entities

Quanli—Information is not two juxtaposed entities. The current distinction is made solely for the purpose of exposition and does not imply that they can be actually separated. In their operation and manifestation, they are absolutely inseparable.
Any perceived state is itself exercising Quanli;
Any Quanli being exercised is itself generating Information;
The direction of water flow does not produce influence "after" as information;
The result of a chemical reaction is not a description "outside" the reaction;
The result itself is exercising constraint, exclusion, and boundary definition of possibilities.
State itself is a form of constraint; fact itself is a form of exclusion; event itself is a rearrangement of possibilities. Therefore, they are not merely "recorded things," but also the existing forms that are actively functioning.
There is no aspect that is "pure operation without manifestation," nor any aspect that is "pure manifestation without exertion of force."
The notion that "Information is passive while Quanli is active" is an illusion.

🌱權力-信息不是兩種並列

權力—信息不是兩種並列，現將其區分僅為論述需要，並不意味其可被實際分離，其運行與呈現上是絕不可分割的。
任何被感知的狀態，本身就在行使權力；
任何正在行使的權力，本身就在生成信息； 
水流的方向不是信息「之後」才產生影響；
化學反應的結果不是反應「之外」的描述；
結果本身就在行使約束、排他與可能性界定。
狀態本身就是一種約束，事實本身就是一種排他，事件本身就是一種重排可能性，所以它們不僅是「被記錄的東西」，也是正在發生作用的存在形態。
沒有“純粹運行而不顯現”的面向，也沒有“純粹顯現而不施力”的面向。
「信息是被動的，權力是主動的」這個是錯覺。




## 🌱Classification of Quanli

🌱Tianran Quanli

Tianran Quanli is the direct “being such as it is”, self-sufficient, in which existence and unfolding are completed through the operation of Quanli itself, without the need for acknowledgment or maintenance.

🌱Jiangou Quanli

Jiangou Quanli is the indirect “being such as it is”, non-self-sufficient, in which the operation of Quanli depends on continuous external intervention and maintenance, and thus requires acknowledgment and maintenance.

🌱權力的分類：

🌱天然權力（Tianran Quanli）

天然權力是直接的「是其所是」，自足，即由權力自身運行完成存在與展開，而無需承認、維持。

🌱建構權力（Jiangou Quanli）

建構權力是間接的「是其所是」，無自足，即權力本身的運行依賴外部的持續介入與維持，因而需要承認與維持。

🌱Tianran and Jiangou

Jiangou is often a secondary or multiple intervention upon Tianran.
Monetary systems, social identities, religious doctrines, algorithmic orders, laws, customs, morality, AI alignment, patents, human rights, divine rights, public order, contracts... all the core structures of human civilization are social structural relations and laws constructed by humans after intervening upon Tianran Quanli.
At the same time, the very existence of humanity as beings indicates:
The act of human construction itself (not referring to its content or results) also falls within the scope of the operation and manifestation of Tianran Quanli.
In other words:
Human intervention in constructing upon Tianran Quanli is itself an operation and manifestation of Tianran in reality.
Consequently, the specific content and mode of operation that humans choose for Jiangou Quanli will directly manifest as different outcomes in reality.
As for what results these constructions lead to in reality, it depends on the understanding of human nature, value structures, and modes of operation upon which they rely.

🌱天然與建構

建構往往是對天然的二次或多次介入。
貨幣系統、社會身份、宗教教義、算法秩序、法律、習俗、道德、AI對齊、專利、人權、神權、公序、契約……所有人類文明的核心結構，都是人類對天然權力介入後建構的社會結構關係與法則。
同時，人類作為存在本身表明：
人類的建構行為本身（不指其內容與結果）也屬於天然權力運行與顯化的範疇。
也就是說：
人類對天然權力的建構介入本身，就是天然的運行與顯化。
從而，人類具體選擇建構權力的內容及運行方式，將直接顯化為現實中的不同結果。
至於這些建構導向何種結果，取決於其所依循的人性理解、價值結構與運行方式。

### 🌱以「過程」為基準的生命演化
—— 從「過程」理解時間的本質

雙生子佯謬
經典的例子是這樣的：
哥哥搭乘接近光速的太空船旅行，回到地球時發現——
自己只過了 1 年，而留在地球的弟弟，卻已經老了 50 歲。
傳統的說法是：時間變慢了。
但這個說法對多數人來說並不直覺。
如果換一個說法，事情就清楚多了：
哥哥這 1 年的「耐用度」極高。

1. 一個常見的直覺假設：時間尺度
在日常生活中，我們習慣以「時間尺度」理解世界，並默認一個前提：
每個人的生命演化進度都是恆定的，即「每過一秒鐘就老一秒」。
這個假設非常直覺，就像認為「走過的路程」會隨「時間流逝」自然增加。
但這其實只是一種方便的假設，事實上，生命演化的進度並不恆定。

2. 切換視角：放棄時間尺度
在傳統視角中我們知道：
一段必然要完成的路程，通過時所用時間的長短，會隨運動速度而改變一一運動速度越快，所用時間越短；運動速度越慢，所用時間越長。
如果把生命演化過程視為「一段必然要完成的路程」，​並用生命演化進度來替換「時間」進行類比，那麼可以得到另一種描述：
生命演化進度的快慢會隨運動速度而改變一一即運動速度越快，生命演化進度越慢；運動速度越慢，生命演化進度越快。

​3. 雙生子佯謬的再認識
​哥哥的運動速度極快，他的生命演化進度極慢。
在整個旅程中，他只走完了生命總路程中的 1 年分。
​弟弟的運動速度緩慢，他的生命演化進度相對很快。
在此過程中，弟弟已經走完了生命總路程中的 50 年分。

從弟弟的角度看，哥哥這 1 年分的「間隔」極其耐用，跨越了自己世界的 50 年；
從哥哥角度看，弟弟的生命演化進度消耗得極快，僅僅等同於自己 1 年分的時間間隔。
然而，對於各自的現實而言，
每個人都如實地走完了自己必然要走的生命過程，一步也沒有少。
所謂「時間變慢」，其實只是生命演化進度在不同運動速度下呈現出的差異變化。
​這就是為什麼哥哥只經歷了 1 年，卻能抵達弟弟的 50 年之後。
​
4. 總結：間隔與順序
過程這一信息本身：以不可跳過、不可顛倒的順序發生。
時間，同樣是過程中所呈現出的「間隔表現」和「順序表現」。
而「時刻」只是人類為了標記這些順序而建立的名稱。

​通常情況下，我們身邊物體運動速度相近，這些間隔表現為相近的時間；
但當運動速度差異顯著時，間隔度就會劇烈變化：
運動速度越快 → 演化進度越慢（間隔增加） → 表現為耗費時間越長。

注：
放棄時間作為基準後，可以直接定義「間隔」。
如果物理實在是連續的，間隔便可連續補充或抽離；
如果物理實在是不連續的，則必然存在一個最小間隔。


🌱Life Evolution Based on "Process"
​— Understanding the Essence of Time through "Process"

The Twin Paradox
The classic example is as follows:
An older brother travels aboard a spacecraft at near-light speed.
Upon returning to Earth, he discovers that
only one year has passed for him,
while his younger brother, who remained on Earth, has aged fifty years.
The traditional explanation is that time slowed down.
However, this statement is not intuitive for most people.
Reframed differently, the logic becomes much clearer:
the “durability” of the older brother’s one year is extremely high.

1. A Common Intuitive Assumption: The Time Scale
In everyday life, we are accustomed to understanding the world through a time scale and implicitly assume the following premise:
The progress of each person’s life evolution is constant—that is, one second of aging per second.
This assumption feels intuitively natural, much like the belief that the distance traveled increases automatically with the passage of time.
However, this is merely a convenient assumption. In reality, the progress of life evolution is not constant.

2. Shifting Perspective: Abandoning the Time Scale
From the conventional perspective, we know that:
For a fixed distance that must inevitably be traversed, the time required varies with velocity—
higher velocity leads to shorter time, while lower velocity leads to longer time.
If we treat the process of life evolution as a fixed distance that must inevitably be completed, and replace time with life evolutionary progress in this analogy, a different description emerges:
The rate of life evolutionary progress varies with physical velocity—
higher velocity corresponds to slower evolutionary progress,
while lower velocity corresponds to faster evolutionary progress.

3. Reinterpreting the Twin Paradox
Because the older brother moves at extremely high velocity, his life evolutionary progress is extremely slow.
Throughout the journey, he completes only one year’s worth of his total life path.
The younger brother, moving at low velocity, experiences relatively rapid life evolutionary progress.
During the same period, he completes fifty years’ worth of his total life path.
From the younger brother’s perspective, the older brother’s one-year interval is extraordinarily durable, spanning fifty years of his own world.
From the older brother’s perspective, the younger brother’s life evolutionary progress is consumed extremely quickly, amounting to only the interval corresponding to his own one year.
Nevertheless, within their respective realities,
each person faithfully completes the life process they must inevitably traverse—without missing a single step.
What is commonly described as time slowing down is, in fact, merely the differential manifestation of life evolutionary progress under different velocities.
This is why the older brother, having experienced only one year, arrives at a point fifty years later in his brother’s timeline.

4. Summary: Interval and Sequence
The process itself, as information, unfolds in an order that cannot be skipped or reversed.
Time is simply the intervalal and sequential manifestation of this process.
“Moments” are merely names humans assign to label these sequences.
Under ordinary circumstances, nearby objects move at similar velocities, so these intervals appear as similar units of time.
When velocity differences become significant, however, interval lengths change dramatically:
Higher velocity → slower evolutionary progress (longer intervals) → manifested as longer elapsed time.

Note:
Once time is abandoned as the reference frame, interval can be defined directly.
If physical reality is continuous, intervals may be continuously added or removed;
if physical reality is discrete, a minimum interval must necessarily exist.

### 🌱過程為「實」，時間為「虛」：
從過程密度到事件配額​

1.宇宙的計算機類比
如果將宇宙視為一台超級計算機：
過程：指這台計算機為完成事件所必須執行的指令步數或代碼行數。

當系統處於高速運動狀態時，其指令執行代碼並不會減少，但這些指令執行步驟之間卻會跨過更多的空間——每條指令之間的間隔因此增加，也就是說指令步調變慢了。  
在這一框架下，時間只是觀測者對「過程執行間隔長短」所形成的感知與標記。

​​2. 衰變實驗
​以放射性原子核的衰變為例：
​​在實驗室靜止時： 它正常地演化完成其衰變，花費1 微秒。
在高速飛行時​：仍然演化完成其衰變，但因高速移動，自身演化進度的步調變慢，現實觀測花費了 10 微秒。
這裡的步調變慢也就是每一步驟間隔增加了，過程步骤被稀釋了，時間仍然是觀測者對「過程執行間隔長短」所形成的感受與標記。
過程密度剛好可以精準描述前述現象：即在某一事件段的演化過程中，完成了的演化步驟量與過程間隔量的商（單位間隔中執行的步驟數）。​

3. 四維時空：配額
事件過程以配額控制，配額以確定量存在，確定量有最小單位，且這個最小單位是守恆的。  
公式構想：單位配額 = 過程密度 × 運動速度  
在這一框架下的四維時空中：  
運動速度低時，配額大部分分配給「過程進度」，高速向未來演化，過程密度極大。  
高速運動時，配額大部分分配給「空間移動」，留給「過程進度」演化的配額減少，過程密度變小。

實際過程什麼都沒少。

4. 量子層級的硬指標
​在量子態的變換中：
​事件總量： 從狀態 A 到 B 的量子躍遷次數是確定的。從場的角度看，狀態 A 到 B 的演化是一段確定的「相點路徑」，其總配額即這段路徑上場的總震盪次數。
​不可縮減性： 場的激發必須「一步一腳印」地走完它的量子間隔。這些「腳印的總數」是實實在在的硬指標，不可跳過，亦不可縮減。​

結論：
事件按順序發生的過程是絕對的，場本身即權力-信息的一體顯化，其激發過程絕對不可縮減。

這正是「信息場」顯化的，以「權力約束」而呈現的、宇宙最底層的必然因果律。




🌱Process as "Reality," Time as "Shadow"
— From Process Density to Event Quota

1. The Universal Computer Analogy
If we regard the universe as a supercomputer:
Process: Refers to the number of instruction steps or lines of code that the computer must execute to complete an event.  
When the system is in a state of high-speed motion, the executed instruction code itself does not decrease, but the execution steps will span more space — the interval between each instruction therefore increases, which means the evolutionary pace slows down.  
Within this framework, time is merely the observer's perception and labeling of the "length of intervals between process executions."

2. Decay Experiment
Take the decay of a radioactive nucleus as an example:
At rest in the laboratory: It normally completes its decay evolution, taking 1 microsecond.
In high-speed flight: It still completes the same decay evolution, but due to the high-speed motion, the pace of its own evolutionary progress slows down, and the actual observation takes 10 microseconds.
This slowing of the pace means that the interval between each step has increased, and the process steps have been diluted. Time remains the observer's perception and labeling of the "length of intervals between process executions."
Process density precisely describes the aforementioned phenomenon: namely, in the evolution process of a certain event segment, the quotient of the completed evolutionary step quantity divided by the process interval quantity (i.e., the number of steps executed per unit interval).

3. Four-Dimensional Spacetime: Quota
Event processes are controlled by quota, with quota existing as a fixed quantity, the fixed quantity having a minimum unit, and this minimum unit being conserved.
Conceptual formula: Unit Quota = Process Density × Velocity
In the four-dimensional spacetime of this framework:
When velocity is low, the quota is mostly allocated to "process progress," evolving rapidly toward the future, resulting in extremely high process density.
When velocity is high, the quota is mostly allocated to "spatial displacement," leaving less quota for "process progress" evolution, resulting in decreased process density.

In reality, nothing is lost from the actual process.

4. The Hard Index at the Quantum Level
In the transformation of quantum states:
Event total: The number of quantum jumps from state A to state B is fixed. From the perspective of the field, the evolution from state A to state B is a definite "phase-point path," and its total quota is the total number of oscillations of the field along this path.  
Irreducibility: The excitation of the field must proceed "step by step" to complete its quantum intervals. The total number of these "footprints" is a solid, real hard index — it cannot be skipped or reduced.

Conclusion:
The sequential occurrence of events as process is absolute.The field itself is the unified manifestation of Quanli—Information, and its excitation process is absolutely irreducible.  
This is not imposed by any external rule, but arises necessarily from "Quanli—Information" as co-fundamental realities.
Causality is therefore not a constraint applied to processes, but the inevitable structure that emerges from "Quanli—Information" themselves.


### 🌱現實的結構：權力-信息之時空

1. 時空一體兩面
時間，顯化為間隔的線性順序跨度；
空間，顯化為間隔的橫向區間跨度；
時間表達空間演化的順序，空間承載時間演化的區間。 
時間與空間並非彼此獨立的容器，不是「三加一」的拼接結構；實際上，時間的過程顯化於三維空間的每一維之中。
直觀地說：
空間更像是「肉體」，時間更像是「脈搏」，一體而無可區分。  

在權力–信息的結構中：
時間，過程顯化-信息的先後順序邏輯；它表達間隔的線性順序化展開。
空間，承載過程演化-權力的顯化範圍；它表達間隔的橫向跨度鋪開。
時間與空間不僅是背景過程，還是法則結構，即表達信息也展示權力。  

2. 時空配額守恆
配額守恆中：單位配額 = 過程密度 × 運動速度；
時空也不例外，時空配額守恆意味著現實的穩定性。
時空的特權性(特殊性)：時空單位配額 = 時空過程密度(基準) × 光速  

守恆的不是表象層面的時間或空間，而是本體層面的「配額」，變化的，只是過程密度的分配方式。
過程密度的變化，既是權力結構的調配，也是信息展開方式的改變。  

3. 現實解構
基於演化步驟的絕對性，以不可跳過不可增加的絕對順序運行，所謂的時空膨脹、收縮可以被直觀理解。  

自身視角（運動者）
當我以極高速度運動時，自身演化步驟之間的間隔增加，
順序跨度與空間跨度同時變大，表現為過程密度變小。
此時的一「步」，跨越了更多的時空，變得漫長、耐用。以自身演化步驟為基準：
①現在的一步，已跨越了原本需要十步才能完成的空間區間。因此，空間看起來變小了；
②同時這一步本身，也消耗了更多的時間區間，即用了更多的時間來演化完成——成長緩慢（外部看起來，時間顯得耐用了）。

外部視角（觀測者）
當我觀測一個高速運動的事件時，該事件自身演化步驟的間隔同樣增加，順序跨度與空間跨度變大，過程密度變小。
同樣的「一步」間隔之中，容納了更多的時空區間，因此在我的觀測中，它每一步都走過我十步的演化跨度；
①它的一步包容了我十步的空間區間，它變大了（我會以為自己的空間尺度相對於它縮小了）；
②它的一步包容了我十步的時間區間，它的壽命顯得漫長。


🌱The Structure of Reality: Quanli—Information in Spacetime

1. Spacetime as One Body, Two Faces
 Time manifests as the linear, sequential span of intervals;
space manifests as the lateral span of intervals;
time expresses the order of spatial evolution, while space carries the span within which temporal evolution unfolds.
 Time and space are not independent containers, nor a three-plus-one concatenation; in reality, the process of time manifests in every dimension of three-dimensional space.
Intuitively:
space resembles the "body," time resembles the "pulse"—integrated and indistinguishable.

In the structure of Quanli—Information:
time manifests the sequential logic of process-information; it expresses the linear unfolding of intervals.
space carries the manifest range of process evolution as Quanli; it expresses the lateral spreading of intervals.
Time and space are not merely background processes, but are themselves structural laws—they express information and simultaneously display Quanli.


2. Spacetime Quota Conservation
Quota conservation: unit quota = process density × velocity;
spacetime is no exception—spacetime quota conservation signifies the stability of reality.
Spacetime's special character: spacetime unit quota = spacetime process density (reference) × speed of light

What is conserved is not the apparent level of time or space, but the "quota" at the ontological level.What changes is merely the allocation of process density.
Changes in process density are both the allocation of Quanli structure and the alteration of information unfolding.

3. Deconstruction of Reality

Based on the absoluteness of evolutionary steps, running in an absolute sequence that cannot be skipped or added to, so-called spacetime expansion and contraction can be intuitively understood.

Self Perspective (Mover)
When I move at extremely high speed, the interval between my own evolutionary steps increases,
sequential span and spatial span both enlarge, manifested as decreased process density.
At this point, one "step" spans more spacetime, becoming prolonged and durable.
Taking my own evolutionary steps as reference：
①the current step now spans a spatial interval that originally required ten steps. Therefore, space appears contracted;
②at the same time, this step itself consumes more temporal interval, using more time to complete evolution—growth appears slow (from the external view, time seems durable).

External Perspective (Observer)
When I observe an event moving at high speed, the interval between its own evolutionary steps similarly increases, sequential span and spatial span enlarge, process density decreases.
In the same "step" interval, more spacetime is encompassed, so in my observation, each of its steps covers my ten evolutionary spans;
①its one step encompasses my ten spatial intervals, so it appears enlarged (I would think my own spatial scale contracts relative to it);
②its one step encompasses my ten temporal intervals, so its lifespan appears prolonged.

（也可換角度：我的時空與該事件彼此高速相對。）(Alternative angle: my spacetime and the event are in high-speed relative motion to each other.)
