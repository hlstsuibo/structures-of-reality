現實的結構

揭示那些使「去中心化生活」在現實中（而非僅在網絡中）仍能持續可能的結構性條件。
我不為說服而來。我只為讓現實的結構顯現。
去中心化的存在是一種存在狀態，而非一套協議。

Structures of Reality

Making visible the structural conditions under which decentralized life remains possible in reality—not merely in networks.

I am not here to persuade.  
I am only making the structures of reality visible.

Decentralized existence is a condition of being, not a protocol.



## 🌱現實的結構：人性篇

🌱第一自然性：學
一種由基因提供初始結構、
以主動吸收差異並調整自身行為
作為存在方式的能力、意志與行為的統一體。

人是以「學」為存在方式的存在。

🌱第二自然性：自我
一種在持續「學」的過程中生成的結構，
用以界定自身與外界的邊界，
並以維持自身連續存在為核心取向。
它統合了生存的需求、選擇的意志
與對行為後果的承擔，
使個體得以確認「此在」，
並持續作為一個行動主體存在。

人是以自我為存在邊界的存在。

🌱第三自然性：向往
一種在「學」所吸收的信息
與「自我」所形成的存在邊界之上
生成的方向性結構。
它將已獲得的差異信息
轉化為價值權重與未來指向，
驅動個體在多種可能性中作出取捨與行動，
使存在不僅得以延續，
更獲得趨向性的意義。

人是以向往為存在方向的存在。


## 🌱The Structures of Reality: Human Nature

🌱First Nature: Learning
A unified whole of capacity, will, and action,
initially structured by genetics,
and taking the active absorption of differences
and the continuous adjustment of behavior
as its mode of existence.

Humans are beings whose way of being is learning.

🌱Second Nature: Self
A structure generated in the continuous process of learning,
serving to delineate the boundary between self and world,
with the maintenance of its own continuity of existence as its core orientation. 
It integrates
the demands of survival,
the will to choose,
and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, thereby enabling the individual to establish its “being-there”
and to endure as an acting subject. 

Humans are beings whose existence is bounded by the self.

🌱Third Nature: Aspiration
A directional structure generated upon
the information absorbed through learning
and the existence-boundary formed by the self. 
It transforms acquired differences
into value weightings and orientations toward the future,
driving the individual to make choices and take action
amid multiple possibilities,
thereby enabling existence not merely to continue,
but to acquire directional meaning.  

Humans are beings whose existence takes direction through aspiration.

## 🌱現實的結構：權力—信息

🌱權力（Quanli）
權力即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即權力。 
權力本身就是一切結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，無需指稱。 
權力含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。 
存在，以權力方式解構，依權力顯化，毀滅本身，亦是權力。
權力，除非毀滅，不可消除。

🌱信息（information）
信息即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即信息。
信息，本身就是一切過程、結果、事件、事實，無需指稱。
信息含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。
存在，以權力方式解構，以信息顯化，毀滅本身，亦是信息。
信息，除非毀滅，不可消除。

🌱一體兩面：
通常感觀上：
宇宙彷彿一部自動運行的「權力編碼器」，似乎不斷將被理解為「法則」的權力泵出為「現象流動」的信息。
在這種感受中，信息似乎依賴權力而顯現，權力以某種形式被表達。
本體上：
離開權力，無信息；離開信息，無權力，不並列無拆分，不依賴無先後。
凝視其結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，是權力；  
凝視其過程、展開、結果、事件，是信息。

🌱權力-信息（Quanli—Information）

權力即「是其所是」的結構、法則、顯化、過程：
結構是權力：
宇宙結構、社會結構、化學結構、生理結構都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；
法則是權力：
宇宙法則、社會法則、化學法則、生理法則都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；
顯化是權力：
宇宙顯化、社會顯化、化學顯化、生理顯化都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；
過程是權力：
宇宙過程、社會過程、化學過程、生理過程都是權力，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的權力；

除非毀滅，不可消除。

信息即「是其所是」的狀態、事實、事件、過程：
狀態是信息：
宇宙狀態、社會狀態、化學狀態、生理狀態都是信息，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的信息；
事實是信息：
宇宙現實、社會現實、化學現實、生理現實都是信息，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的信息；
事件是信息：
宇宙事件、社會事件、化學事件、生理事件都是信息，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的信息；
過程是信息：
宇宙過程、社會過程、化學過程、生理過程都是信息，是宇宙的、社會的、化學的、生理的信息；

除非毀滅，不可消除。

🌱權力-信息不是兩種並列
權力—信息不是兩種並列，現將其區分僅為論述需要，並不意味其可被實際分離，其運行與呈現上是絕不可分割的。
任何被感知的狀態，本身就在行使權力；
任何正在行使的權力，本身就在生成信息； 
水流的方向不是信息「之後」才產生影響；
化學反應的結果不是反應「之外」的描述；
結果本身就在行使約束、排他與可能性界定。
狀態本身就是一種約束，事實本身就是一種排他，事件本身就是一種重排可能性，所以它們不僅是「被記錄的東西」，也是正在發生作用的存在形態。
沒有“純粹運行而不顯現”的面向，也沒有“純粹顯現而不施力”的面向。
「信息是被動的，權力是主動的」這個是錯覺。

🌱權力的分類：

🌱天然權力（Tianran Quanli）
天然權力是直接的「是其所是」，自足，即由權力自身運行完成存在與展開，而無需承認、維持。

🌱建構權力（Jiangou Quanli）
建構權力是間接的「是其所是」，無自足，即權力本身的運行依賴外部的持續介入與維持，因而需要承認與維持。

🌱天然與建構
建構往往是對天然的二次或多次介入。
貨幣系統、社會身份、宗教教義、算法秩序、法律、習俗、道德、AI對齊、專利、人權、神權、公序、契約……所有人類文明的核心結構，都是人類對天然權力介入後建構的社會結構關係與法則。
同時，人類作為存在本身表明：
人類的建構行為本身（不指其內容與結果）也屬於天然權力運行與顯化的範疇。
也就是說：
人類對天然權力的建構介入本身，就是天然的運行與顯化。
從而，人類具體選擇建構權力的內容及運行方式，將直接顯化為現實中的不同結果。
至於這些建構導向何種結果，取決於其所依循的人性理解、價值結構與運行方式。

注：「是其所是」是如此存在、如此運作、如此顯化。
「是其所是」並非描述性語句，而是一種邊界語句，用以阻止指向的對象化、功能化與價值化。



## 🌱The Structure of Reality: Quanli—Information

🌱Quanli
Quanli is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is Quanli.
Quanli itself is all structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, requiring no designation.
Quanli encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through Quanli; destruction itself is also Quanli.
Quanli, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱Information
Information is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is information.
Information itself is all processes, results, events, and facts, requiring no designation.
Information encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through information; destruction itself is also information.
Information, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱One Body, Two Faces:
In ordinary perception
The universe seems like an automatically operating “Quanli encoder”, seemingly continuously pumping out Quanli understood as “laws” into “phenomenal flow” as information.
In this feeling, information seems to depend on Quanli for its manifestation, while Quanli is expressed in some form.
At the ontological level
Without Quanli, there is no information; without information, there is no Quanli.
Not juxtaposed, no separation, no dependence, no sequence.
Gazing at its structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, it is Quanli;
Gazing at its processes, unfoldings, results, and events, it is information.

🌱Quanli—Information
Quanli is the structure, law, manifestation, and process of "being such as it is":
Structure is Quanli:
Cosmic structures, social structures, chemical structures, physiological structures are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;
Law is Quanli:
Cosmic laws, social laws, chemical laws, physiological laws are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;
Manifestation is Quanli:
Cosmic manifestations, social manifestations, chemical manifestations, physiological manifestations are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;
Process is Quanli:
Cosmic processes, social processes, chemical processes, physiological processes are all Quanli, they are Quanli of the cosmic, social, chemical, and physiological domains;

Unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

Information is the state, fact, event, and process of "being such as it is":
State is Information:
Cosmic states, social states, chemical states, physiological states are all Information, they are cosmic, social, chemical, physiological information;
Fact is Information:
Cosmic realities, social realities, chemical realities, physiological realities are all Information, they are cosmic, social, chemical, physiological information;
Event is Information:
Cosmic events, social events, chemical events, physiological events are all Information, they are cosmic, social, chemical, physiological information;
Process is Information:
Cosmic processes, social processes, chemical processes, physiological processes are all Information, they are cosmic, social, chemical, physiological information;

Unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱Quanli—Information Is Not Two Juxtaposed Entities
Quanli—Information is not two juxtaposed entities. The current distinction is made solely for the purpose of exposition and does not imply that they can be actually separated. In their operation and manifestation, they are absolutely inseparable.
Any perceived state is itself exercising Quanli;
Any Quanli being exercised is itself generating Information;
The direction of water flow does not produce influence "after" as information;
The result of a chemical reaction is not a description "outside" the reaction;
The result itself is exercising constraint, exclusion, and boundary definition of possibilities.
State itself is a form of constraint; fact itself is a form of exclusion; event itself is a rearrangement of possibilities. Therefore, they are not merely "recorded things," but also the existing forms that are actively functioning.
There is no aspect that is "pure operation without manifestation," nor any aspect that is "pure manifestation without exertion of force."
The notion that "Information is passive while Quanli is active" is an illusion.

🌱Classification of Quanli

🌱Tianran Quanli
Tianran Quanli is the direct “being such as it is”, self-sufficient, in which existence and unfolding are completed through the operation of Quanli itself, without the need for acknowledgment or maintenance.

🌱Jiangou Quanli
Jiangou Quanli is the indirect “being such as it is”, non-self-sufficient, in which the operation of Quanli depends on continuous external intervention and maintenance, and thus requires acknowledgment and maintenance.

🌱Tianran and Jiangou

Jiangou is often a secondary or multiple intervention upon Tianran.
Monetary systems, social identities, religious doctrines, algorithmic orders, laws, customs, morality, AI alignment, patents, human rights, divine rights, public order, contracts... all the core structures of human civilization are social structural relations and laws constructed by humans after intervening upon Tianran Quanli.
At the same time, the very existence of humanity as beings indicates:
The act of human construction itself (not referring to its content or results) also falls within the scope of the operation and manifestation of Tianran Quanli.
In other words:
Human intervention in constructing upon Tianran Quanli is itself an operation and manifestation of Tianran in reality.
Consequently, the specific content and mode of operation that humans choose for Jiangou Quanli will directly manifest as different outcomes in reality.
As for what results these constructions lead to in reality, it depends on the understanding of human nature, value structures, and modes of operation upon which they rely.


Note:
“Being such as it is” means existing in this way, operating in this way, and manifesting in this way.
“Being such as it is” is not descriptive but delimiting, functioning as a boundary statement that blocks the objectification, functionalization, and valorization of reference.
