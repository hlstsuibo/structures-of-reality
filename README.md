Structures of Reality

Making visible the structural conditions under which decentralized life remains possible in reality—not merely in networks.

I am not here to persuade.  
I am only making the structures of reality visible.

Decentralized existence is a condition of being, not a protocol.

注：「是其所是」是如此存在、如此運作、如此顯化。
「是其所是」並非描述性語句，而是一種邊界語句，用以阻止指向的對象化、功能化與價值化。

Note:
“Being such as it is” means existing in this way, operating in this way, and manifesting in this way.
“Being such as it is” is not descriptive but delimiting, functioning as a boundary statement that blocks the objectification, functionalization, and valorization of reference.

## 🌱 Root 

## First Nature: Learning

A unified whole of capacity, will, and action,
initially structured by genetics,
and taking the active absorption of differences
and the continuous adjustment of behavior
as its mode of existence.

Humans are beings whose way of being is learning.

第一自然性：學

一種由基因提供初始結構、
以主動吸收差異並調整自身行為
作為存在方式的能力、意志與行為的統一體。

人是以「學」為存在方式的存在。

## Second Nature: Self

A structure generated in the continuous process of learning,
serving to delineate the boundary between self and world,
with the maintenance of its own continuity of existence as its core orientation. 
It integrates
the demands of survival,
the will to choose,
and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, thereby enabling the individual to establish its “being-there”
and to endure as an acting subject. 

Humans are beings whose existence is bounded by the self.

第二自然性：自我

一種在持續「學」的過程中生成的結構，
用以界定自身與外界的邊界，
並以維持自身連續存在為核心取向。
它統合了生存的需求、選擇的意志
與對行為後果的承擔，
使個體得以確認「此在」，
並持續作為一個行動主體存在。

人是以自我為存在邊界的存在。

## Third Nature: Aspiration

A directional structure generated upon
the information absorbed through learning
and the existence-boundary formed by the self. 
It transforms acquired differences
into value weightings and orientations toward the future,
driving the individual to make choices and take action
amid multiple possibilities,
thereby enabling existence not merely to continue,
but to acquire directional meaning.  

Humans are beings whose existence takes direction through aspiration.

第三自然性：向往

一種在「學」所吸收的信息
與「自我」所形成的存在邊界之上
生成的方向性結構。
它將已獲得的差異信息
轉化為價值權重與未來指向，
驅動個體在多種可能性中作出取捨與行動，
使存在不僅得以延續，
更獲得趨向性的意義。

人是以向往為存在方向的存在。


## 🌱🌱The Structure of Reality: Quanli—Information
🌱🌱現實的結構：權力—信息。

## 
🌱Quanli
Quanli is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is Quanli.
Quanli itself is all structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, requiring no designation.
Quanli encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through Quanli; destruction itself is also Quanli.
Quanli, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱Information
Information is “being such as it is”.
“Being such as it is” is information.
Information itself is all processes, results, events, and facts, requiring no designation.
Information encompasses existence and all descriptions, independent of perception or recording.
Existence is deconstructed in the mode of Quanli and manifested through information; destruction itself is also information.
Information, unless destroyed, cannot be eliminated.

🌱權力（Quanli）
權力即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即權力。 
權力本身就是一切結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，無需指稱。 
權力含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。 
存在，以權力方式解構，依權力顯化，毀滅本身，亦是權力。
權力，除非毀滅，不可消除。

🌱信息（information）
信息即「是其所是」。 「是其所是」即信息。
信息，本身就是一切過程、結果、事件、事實，無需指稱。
信息含存在及一切描述，無關感知、記錄。
存在，以權力方式解構，以信息顯化，毀滅本身，亦是信息。
信息，除非毀滅，不可消除。


## 
🌱One Body, Two Faces:
In ordinary perception
The universe seems like an automatically operating “Quanli encoder”, seemingly continuously pumping out Quanli understood as “laws” into “phenomenal flow” as information.
In this feeling, information seems to depend on Quanli for its manifestation, while Quanli is expressed in some form.
At the ontological level
Without Quanli, there is no information; without information, there is no Quanli.
Not juxtaposed, no separation, no dependence, no sequence.
Gazing at its structures, relations, laws, attributes, and manifestations, it is Quanli;
Gazing at its processes, unfoldings, results, and events, it is information.

🌱一體兩面：
通常感觀上：
宇宙彷彿一部自動運行的「權力編碼器」，似乎不斷將被理解為「法則」的權力泵出為「現象流動」的信息。
在這種感受中，信息似乎依賴權力而顯現，權力以某種形式被表達。
本體上：
離開權力，無信息；離開信息，無權力，不並列無拆分，不依賴無先後。
凝視其結構、關係、法則、屬性、顯化，是權力；  
凝視其過程、展開、結果、事件，是信息。


## 🌱Classification of Quanli

🌱Tianran Quanli
Tianran Quanli is the direct “being such as it is”, self-sufficient, in which existence and unfolding are completed through the operation of Quanli itself, without the need for acknowledgment or maintenance.

🌱Jiangou Quanli
Jiangou Quanli is the indirect “being such as it is”, non-self-sufficient, in which the operation of Quanli depends on continuous external intervention and maintenance, and thus requires acknowledgment and maintenance.

🌱權力的分類：

🌱天然權力（Tianran Quanli）
天然權力是直接的「是其所是」，自足，即由權力自身運行完成存在與展開，而無需承認、維持。

🌱建構權力（Jiangou Quanli）
建構權力是間接的「是其所是」，無自足，即權力本身的運行依賴外部的持續介入與維持，因而需要承認與維持。

🌱Tianran and Jiangou

Jiangou is often a secondary or multiple intervention upon Tianran.
Monetary systems, social identities, religious doctrines, algorithmic orders, laws, customs, morality, AI alignment, patents, human rights, divine rights, public order, contracts... all the core structures of human civilization are social structural relations and laws constructed by humans after intervening upon Tianran Quanli.
At the same time, the very existence of humanity as beings indicates:
The act of human construction itself (not referring to its content or results) also falls within the scope of the operation and manifestation of Tianran Quanli.
In other words:
Human intervention in constructing upon Tianran Quanli is itself an operation and manifestation of Tianran in reality.
Consequently, the specific content and mode of operation that humans choose for Jiangou Quanli will directly manifest as different outcomes in reality.
As for what results these constructions lead to in reality, it depends on the understanding of human nature, value structures, and modes of operation upon which they rely.

🌱天然與建構

建構往往是對天然的二次或多次介入。
貨幣系統、社會身份、宗教教義、算法秩序、法律、習俗、道德、AI對齊、專利、人權、神權、公序、契約……所有人類文明的核心結構，都是人類對天然權力介入後建構的社會結構關係與法則。
同時，人類作為存在本身表明：
人類的建構行為本身（不指其內容與結果）也屬於天然權力運行與顯化的範疇。
也就是說：
人類對天然權力的建構介入本身，就是天然的運行與顯化。
從而，人類具體選擇建構權力的內容及運行方式，將直接顯化為現實中的不同結果。
至於這些建構導向何種結果，取決於其所依循的人性理解、價值結構與運行方式。
